## The Story

_In a world ravaged by a viral, cross-species epidemic that has caused reptiles to grow to monstrous sizes and become the dominant predators, humanity's survival hinges on living above an invisible boundary known as the "snake line." This term refers to the geographical limit beyond which snakes cannot survive due to inhospitable environmental conditions. At elevations above 10,000 feet (approximately 3,000 meters) or in regions above the Arctic Circle, the extreme cold temperatures and low oxygen levels create a natural barrier, protecting the remnants of human civilization._

_Life above the snake line is harsh but stable, with communities striving to maintain a semblance of normalcy. However, the precarious peace is shattered when Ramona falls gravely ill. The only cure lies in the medicinal properties of plants that thrive in the dangerous, reptile-infested regions below. The plant was once abundant above the snake line but has recently stopped being able to grow above the snake line for unknown reasons.
_
_Driven by love and desperation, Raymond and Betsy embark on a perilous journey to retrieve the life-saving plants. Their quest takes them down treacherous mountain paths, through abandoned cities, and into the heart of the serpentine territory. Along the way, they encounter survivors who have adapted in unique and sometimes unsettling ways, each with their own stories of loss and survival.
_
_Raymond and Betsy's expedition is fraught with danger as they navigate the desolate and reptile-infested landscapes below the snake line. They must use their wits and resourcefulness to evade the colossal reptiles, survive the elements, and find the plants needed to save Ramona. Their journey tests their endurance, bravery, and the strength of their familial bonds.
_
_Raymond and Betsy's mission culminates in a climactic encounter with the apex predators that now rule the lower world. Their success hinges on their ability to outsmart the reptiles and overcome the seemingly insurmountable challenges posed by the hostile environment. Ultimately, their journey brings them face to face with the true nature of survival and the sacrifices required to secure a future for their family.
_
_Beyond the Snake Line is a gripping tale of adventure, survival, and the unbreakable bonds of family. It offers a poignant reflection on the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring hope that, even in the darkest of times, love and determination can light the way.
